# Overview
USIS Brain v6.2 is an Institutional-Grade Multi-AI Financial Analysis System designed for professional investment research. It integrates six AI models with real-time financial data to provide authoritative, data-backed investment recommendations. Key capabilities include semantic intent parsing, global stock discovery, anti-hallucination data validation, intelligent model routing, Vision AI chart analysis, and automated workflow management. The system is built for deployment on Replit's Reserved VM platform, aiming for institutional-grade analysis with multilingual support and cost optimization.

## Recent Changes (v6.2 - 2025-11-13)
**International Stock Symbol Resolution Fix** - Resolved critical issue where Spanish stocks (e.g., "分析西班牙股票 COL") were incorrectly mapped to NASDAQ:COL instead of BME:COL. The fix implements exchange-aware fallback logic that respects user intent across 80+ global exchanges.

**Key Improvements**:
- Added `exchangePreference` parameter threading from semantic intent to chart service
- Enhanced `mapExchangeToTradingView` to recognize BME/XMAD/Madrid/Spain exchange codes
- Implemented token normalization to handle compound hints like "Spain/BME" or "BME:COL"
- Added Symbol Policy logging (🎯) for exchange routing transparency
- Fixed version command (/版本) to show deployment environment and uptime

# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Application Framework
The system uses Node.js with Express.js, providing a RESTful JSON API (`USIS.v3`) with standardized, versioned, and multilingual responses, including model voting, confidence scores, and semantic tagging.

## Core Architecture (v6.0 Multi-AI Pipeline)
The v6.0 pipeline processes user input via language detection, semantic intent parsing, and symbol resolution. A Multi-Dimensional Data Broker fetches real-time financial data, feeding it to an Intelligent Model Router that selects the optimal AI model from a Multi-AI Provider. A Compliance Guard validates the output before professional report formatting and cost tracking.

**Key Components & Logic**:
- **Intelligent Model Routing**: Selects AI models based on task characteristics (e.g., DeepSeek V3 for Chinese input, Claude 3.5 Sonnet for long-form analysis, Gemini 2.5 Flash for fast summarization, Perplexity Sonar Pro for real-time news, default to OpenAI GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini).
- **Intelligent Conversation System**: Manages natural dialogue, smart help, context memory, strict command matching, and AI-powered casual chat.
- **Intelligent Symbol Disambiguation**: Employs a 3-tier confidence algorithm for precise matching and handles ambiguity via user selection.
- **Semantic Intent Understanding**: AI-powered parsing for market states, position context, buy price extraction, and holding intent detection.
- **Intelligent Stock Analysis System**: API-first approach queries Finnhub for dynamic exchange identification and smart exchange mapping, supporting global exchanges.
- **Multi-Dimensional Data Broker with 3-Tier API Cascade**: Utilizes Finnhub (primary US) → Twelve Data (global) → Alpha Vantage (backup) with provider-specific symbol formatting, intelligent failover, and capability caching for over 30 exchanges.
- **ImpactRank Algorithm**: Proprietary 4-dimensional news scoring (urgency × relevance × authority × freshness).
- **Institutional Analysis Framework**: Follows a 5-section report structure with mandatory data citations, authoritative language, and specific price targets.
- **Vision AI Integration**: Analyzes chart patterns and integrates with fundamental data.
- **Anti-Hallucination System**: Multi-layer system for data validation, forced citations, and compliance checks.
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitors costs, response times, and model usage using PostgreSQL.
- **Multilingual Intelligence**: Automatic language detection, Google Translate integration, and specialized Chinese financial analysis via DeepSeek.
- **API Timeout Protection**: Implements AbortController for OpenAI (15s) and Finnhub (10s) APIs, and enhanced error catching for Telegram.

## News System Architecture (N8N-Distributed + Chinese Translation)
This system provides institutional-grade news aggregation with distributed processing, automated translation, and AI commentary.
**Architecture Pattern: "Eyes & Brain"**
- **N8N ("Eyes")**: Handles lightweight RSS collection from 18 premium sources every 15 minutes.
- **USIS Brain ("Brain")**: Performs heavy computation including Google Translate translation (EN/ES/DE→CN), GPT-4o AI commentary generation, ImpactRank 2.0 scoring (7 factors), deduplication (24h URL + 6h topic hash), routing, and push notifications.
**Data Flow:** N8N collects RSS feeds, formats data, and posts to USIS Brain's `/api/news/ingest` endpoint. USIS Brain enhances, deduplicates, scores, routes, and pushes news. A scheduler handles even-hour digest pushes and cache cleanup.

## AI Models
The system orchestrates 6 AI models:
- **OpenAI GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini**: General analysis and cost-optimized fallback.
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: For long-form, in-depth analysis.
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: For ultra-fast summarization.
- **DeepSeek V3**: Specialized for Chinese financial analysis.
- **Mistral Large**: For fast, multilingual reasoning.
- **Perplexity Sonar Pro**: For real-time search-enhanced analysis.

## Screenshot Architecture & N8N Automation
A multi-tier screenshot architecture ensures stability, leveraging N8N for workflow automation including stock chart screenshots and health monitoring.
