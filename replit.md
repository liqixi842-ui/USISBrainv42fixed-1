# Overview
USIS Brain v6.0 is an institutional-grade Multi-AI Financial Analysis System designed for professional investment research. It integrates six AI models with real-time financial data to provide authoritative, data-backed investment recommendations. Key capabilities include semantic intent parsing, global stock discovery, anti-hallucination data validation, intelligent model routing, Vision AI chart analysis, and automated workflow management. The system is built for deployment on Replit's Reserved VM platform, aiming for institutional-grade analysis with multilingual support and cost optimization.

The system is currently stable at `v2-stable` for production, with `v3-dev` actively under development for new features like a comprehensive research report system (v3.1), a multi-model research pipeline (v3.2), and a professional correction layer (v4.0) to refine AI-generated text.

## Recent Changes (Nov 19, 2025)

### v5.2 Critical Fix - Eliminated "Analysis not available." Bug
**Status**: ✅ Architect-Approved, Ready for Production Testing

**Problem Fixed**: AI generation failures previously caused empty content sections showing "Analysis not available." in Investment Thesis, Company Overview, Industry Trends, and Macro Environment sections.

**Solution Implemented**: Three-layer content protection system:
1. Primary AI generation with institutional prompts
2. Retry with exponential backoff
3. **NEW**: Data-driven fallback generation using real report data

**All 5 sections now guaranteed to display substantive content (400-1000+ chars) even when AI fails:**
- Investment Thesis: Uses actual report.rating, revenue, margins, price targets
- Company Overview: Business model, segment breakdown, operational metrics
- Valuation Analysis: Multiple-based framework with conditional data display
- Industry Trends: Industry structure, competition, regulatory outlook
- Macro Environment: Fed policy, FX, fiscal developments, technicals

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Fixed hardcoded "BUY rating" bug - now uses actual report.rating
- ✅ Fixed misleading "$0" displays - conditional logic omits missing metrics
- ✅ Added analyst voice attributions (2-4 per section)
- ✅ Removed prohibited words (compelling, attractive, supportive)
- ✅ All fallbacks use institutional sell-side language

**Files Modified**: `v3_dev/services/v5/writerStockV3.js`, `v3_dev/V5.2_CRITICAL_FIX.md`

# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Application Framework
The system uses Node.js with Express.js, providing a RESTful JSON API (`USIS.v3`) with standardized, versioned, and multilingual responses, including model voting, confidence scores, and semantic tagging.

## Core Architecture (v6.0 Multi-AI Pipeline)
The v6.0 pipeline processes user input via language detection, semantic intent parsing, and symbol resolution. A Multi-Dimensional Data Broker fetches real-time financial data, feeding it to an Intelligent Model Router that selects the optimal AI model from a Multi-AI Provider. A Compliance Guard validates the output before professional report formatting and cost tracking.

**Key Components & Logic**:
- **Intelligent Model Routing**: Selects AI models based on task characteristics (e.g., DeepSeek V3 for Chinese input, Claude 3.5 Sonnet for long-form analysis, Gemini 2.5 Flash for fast summarization, Perplexity Sonar Pro for real-time news, default to OpenAI GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini).
- **Intelligent Conversation System**: Manages natural dialogue, smart help, context memory, strict command matching, and AI-powered casual chat.
- **Intelligent Symbol Disambiguation**: Employs a 3-tier confidence algorithm for precise matching and handles ambiguity via user selection.
- **Semantic Intent Understanding**: AI-powered parsing for market states, position context, buy price extraction, and holding intent detection.
- **Intelligent Stock Analysis System**: API-first approach queries Finnhub for dynamic exchange identification and smart exchange mapping, supporting global exchanges.
- **Multi-Dimensional Data Broker with 3-Tier API Cascade**: Utilizes Finnhub (primary US) → Twelve Data (global) → Alpha Vantage (backup) with provider-specific symbol formatting, intelligent failover, and capability caching for over 30 exchanges.
- **ImpactRank Algorithm**: Proprietary 4-dimensional news scoring (urgency × relevance × authority × freshness).
- **Institutional Analysis Framework**: Follows a 5-section report structure with mandatory data citations, authoritative language, and specific price targets.
- **Vision AI Integration**: Analyzes chart patterns and integrates with fundamental data.
- **Anti-Hallucination System**: Multi-layer system for data validation, forced citations, and compliance checks.
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitors costs, response times, and model usage using PostgreSQL.
- **Multilingual Intelligence**: Automatic language detection, Google Translate integration, and specialized Chinese financial analysis via DeepSeek.
- **API Timeout Protection**: Implements AbortController for OpenAI (15s) and Finnhub (10s) APIs, and enhanced error catching for Telegram.

## News System Architecture (N8N-Distributed + Chinese Translation)
This system provides institutional-grade news aggregation with distributed processing, automated translation, and AI commentary. It uses an "Eyes & Brain" architecture where N8N handles lightweight RSS collection, and USIS Brain performs heavy computation including translation, AI commentary generation, ImpactRank 2.0 scoring, deduplication, routing, and push notifications.

## AI Models
The system orchestrates 6 AI models:
- **OpenAI GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini**: General analysis and cost-optimized fallback.
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: For long-form, in-depth analysis.
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: For ultra-fast summarization.
- **DeepSeek V3**: Specialized for Chinese financial analysis.
- **Mistral Large**: For fast, multilingual reasoning.
- **Perplexity Sonar Pro**: For real-time search-enhanced analysis.

## Screenshot Architecture & N8N Automation
A multi-tier screenshot architecture ensures stability, leveraging N8N for workflow automation including stock chart screenshots and health monitoring.
