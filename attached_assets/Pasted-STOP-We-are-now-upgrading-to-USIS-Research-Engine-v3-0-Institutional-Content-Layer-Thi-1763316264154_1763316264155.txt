STOP.

We are now upgrading to **USIS Research Engine v3.0 — Institutional Content Layer**.  
This upgrade is MANDATORY and NON-NEGOTIABLE.

v3.0 focuses entirely on **professional sell-side research writing**, not structure or data.  
The goal is to produce research text comparable to Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, or J.P. Morgan.

You must implement ALL the following modules exactly as written.

────────────────────────────────────────
0) CORE GOAL (v3.0)
────────────────────────────────────────

Every text section (summary, thesis, valuation, segments, macro, catalysts, risks, technicals, action)
must be rewritten using **professional institutional tone** and grounded in REAL data from the v2.1 report.

Requirements:

- No generic AI phrases  
- No generalities (“AI demand is growing”)  
- No template filler  
- Must reference specific numbers from report data  
- Must include domain knowledge depending on asset_type  
- Must include forward-looking statements  
- Must adopt “sell-side analyst writing style”

This is NOT optional.

────────────────────────────────────────

- Why the stock is cheap/expensive  
- Justify the target multiple used in the model  
Tone: JP Morgan / UBS valuation commentary.”

────────────────── SEGMENT TEXT ──────────────────

Explain each business segment (Data Center, Gaming, Pro Visualization, Automotive if available).  
If segment data is null, write:  
- Expected contribution of each segment  
- Industry trends

Tone: Institutional catalysts section.”

────────────────── RISKS TEXT ──────────────────

Tone: Sell-side risk factors.”

────────────────── TECHNICAL VIEW TEXT ──────────────────
“Provide a technical view using RSI/EMAs/support/resistance.

Tone: Institutional action plan.”

────────────────────────────────────────
2) TEXT MUST INCLUDE REAL DATA (NO GENERICS)
────────────────────────────────────────

You must embed real numbers:

- price.last  
- valuation.pe_ttm / pe_forward  
- valuation.ps_ttm  
- fundamentals.gross_margin / net_margin  
- targets.base.price / bull / bear  
- technical support/resistance  
- peer PE / PS values  

This is required.  
ANY paragraph missing real data = FAIL.

────────────────────────────────────────
3) TONE REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────────────────────

You must adopt PROFESSIONAL SELL-SIDE TONE:

- authoritative  
- data-driven  
- industry-aware  
- forward-looking  
- avoid AI-generic tone  
- avoid sensational language  

Examples (you MUST mirror this tone):

“NVDA remains the dominant beneficiary in the early innings of the AI infrastructure cycle, with Data Center demand accelerating into FY25.”

“Valuation remains elevated at 53x forward earnings, but justified by 50% expected EPS growth.”

“Peer comparison suggests a premium multiple is warranted given NVDA’s structural margin profile.”

────────────────────────────────────────
4) OUTPUT MUST PASS THESE TESTS
────────────────────────────────────────

A text section is ACCEPTABLE **ONLY IF**:

1. It references specific numbers from the report  
2. It references peers when relevant  
3. It is symbol-specific  
4. It is non-generic  
5. It includes forward-looking statements  
6. It reflects sell-side writing style  
7. It contains no hallucinated data  
8. It contains no template phrases

If ANY condition fails → FAIL v3.0.

────────────────────────────────────────
5) FINAL DELIVERABLES FOR v3.0

You MUST produce:

1. /tmp/NVDA_v3_report.json
