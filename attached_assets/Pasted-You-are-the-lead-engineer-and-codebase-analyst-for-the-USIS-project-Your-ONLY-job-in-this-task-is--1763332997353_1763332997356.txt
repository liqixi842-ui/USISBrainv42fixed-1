You are the lead engineer and codebase analyst for the USIS project.
Your ONLY job in this task is:
👉 Find out the current status of the PDF / research report (研报) system in this repo and write a status report.
Do NOT design or implement a new system yet. Just analyze and document what already exists.

STEP 0 – Scan the repo for anything related to “report” / “pdf”

Please do a full-repo analysis and answer these questions, based ONLY on the actual code in this Repl:

PDF / document libraries

Check package.json (and any other dependency files) and list ALL libraries related to PDF / documents / exports, e.g.:

pdfkit, @react-pdf/renderer, jspdf, puppeteer, playwright, html-pdf, docx, etc.

For each such library, list:

the library name

version

where it is imported/used (file paths).

Existing “report” or “export” endpoints

Search the codebase for keywords:
report, reports, pdf, export, document, research, analysisReport

For each HTTP route or handler that looks related (for example /report, /reports, /export, /download), list:

HTTP method + path (e.g. POST /api/report/generate)

file path

handler function name.

Existing report / template modules

Search for any modules that look like templates or layout for reports, for example:

files under folders named report, reports, pdf, templates, documents, exports

or file names like *Report*, *Pdf*, *Template*, *Document*.

For each such file, summarize in 1–2 lines what it seems to do:

e.g. “renders HTML string for a stock report”, “defines TypeScript types for report sections”, etc.

Backend framework and routing structure

Identify what backend framework is being used:

e.g. Express, Fastify, Hono, Next.js API routes, raw http, etc.

Summarize how HTTP routes are organized:

for example “src/server.ts registers routes from src/routes/*.ts”.

AI analysis / long-form content modules

Find any modules that generate long-form analysis for stocks / indices / markets, such as:

orchestrate, brain, analysis, insights, news, summary, report.

List:

their file paths

a short description of what they output (e.g. “multi-model voting summary for one symbol”).

Environment variables / config related to reports or PDFs

Scan configuration and env usage for keys containing:
REPORT, PDF, DOC, EXPORT.

List any such env vars or config keys, and where they are used.

Deliverable

Create a markdown file at the root of the repo named:

USIS_REPORT_PDF_STATUS.md

The file should have this structure:

Overview

One short paragraph summarizing:

whether a report/PDF system already exists,

whether it is partial / experimental / unused,

or not present at all.

PDF / Document Libraries

Table listing each relevant library and where it is used.

Existing Report / Export Endpoints

Table of existing HTTP endpoints related to reports/exports (if any).

Existing Templates or Report Modules

Bullet list of files + 1–2 line descriptions.

AI Analysis Modules Potentially Reusable for Reports

Bullet list of modules that could feed content into a report.

Config / Env Related to Reports/PDF

Bullet list of env/config keys and their purpose (if known).

Current Gaps / Open Questions

A clear list of what is missing to have a production-ready research report PDF service,
for example:

“No PDF library installed”

“Has HTML template but no PDF renderer”

“Has PDF generator but no HTTP endpoint”

etc.

When you’re done, briefly summarize the main findings in the chat (5–10 bullet points) AND make sure USIS_REPORT_PDF_STATUS.md is saved in the repo.

Do NOT start designing or implementing a new report system yet.
This task is diagnostic only. Implementation will be a separate step after we review this status report.
